# UQ-ML-Project-Showcase

A collection of my academic machine learning and data science assignments completed as part of my coursework at The University of Queensland (UQ). These projects serve purely as learning experiences and do not include production-level deployment or containerization.

---

## Overview

This repository contains two major projects built to explore ML algorithms, data analysis techniques, and evaluation methods within a controlled academic setting.

---

## Included Projects

### Bushfire Hazard Reduction Feasibility Prediction

- **Task:** Predict whether a controlled burn can be safely conducted based on historical weather data.  
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing · Class imbalance handling · Decision Tree · Random Forest · Artificial Neural Network · Support Vector Machine · Gaussian Naïve Bayes  
- **Deliverable:** `BFHR-Feasibility-Analysis.pdf`

### Tweet Sentiment Analysis

- **Task:** Classify tweet sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using NLP techniques.  
- **Methods:**  
  - Text preparation (tokenization · case-folding · stemming · stop-word removal)  
  - Feature extraction (TF-IDF vectorization · word-frequency analysis)  
  - Classification models (Naïve Bayes · SVM · Random Forest · Logistic Regression)  
- **Deliverable:** `Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis.pdf`

## Future Work

Additional coursework or personal learning projects may be added over time.

---

## Project Scope

These assignments were developed for academic purposes only. They have not been optimized for production use, deployment, or containerization. The emphasis is on exploring algorithmic behavior, data processing workflows, and performance evaluation.
