# UQ-ML-Project-Showcase
A Collection of my Machine Learning Assignments from The University of Queensland

Overview
This repository contains my academic machine learning and data science projects completed as part of my coursework at The University of Queensland (UQ). These projects serve as learning experiences rather than professional implementations and do not include production-level ML deployment or containerization.

ðŸ“‚ Included Projects
Bushfire Hazard Reduction Feasibility Prediction

Task: Predict whether a controlled burn can be safely conducted based on historical weather data.
Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, and classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, ANN, SVM, etc.).
File: BFHR-Feasibility-Analysis.pdf
Tweet Sentiment Analysis

Task: Perform sentiment classification on tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Techniques Used: Data cleaning, feature extraction, and machine learning classifiers.

Future projects may be added as part of coursework or personal learning.

Note on Project Scope
These projects were developed for academic purposes as part of university coursework. They are not production-ready machine learning models and have not been optimized for deployment. The focus was on exploring ML algorithms, data analysis, and evaluation methods within a controlled learning environment.
